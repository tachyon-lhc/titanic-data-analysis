# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction

A focused machine learning project based on the Kaggle Titanic dataset, dedicated to predicting passenger survival. This repository provides the complete workflow from data exploration to final prediction.

## âœ¨ Project Highlights

This project includes in-depth analysis and modeling:

1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visual insights into the data's core relationships.
2.  **Feature Engineering:** Strategic data preparation for optimal model performance.
3.  **Predictive Modeling:** Training and evaluation of machine learning classifiers.
4.  **Reporting:** Detailed metrics and final prediction generation.

## ðŸ“Š Key Visualizations & Reports

The project uses visualizations to clearly illustrate the most impactful features:

| Visualization              | Description                                                            | Insight                                                       |
| :------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Age Distribution Plot**  | Histogram showing passenger age spread.                                | _Identifies age groups most represented._                     |
| **Survival by Class Plot** | Bar chart comparing survival rates across Pclass (1st, 2nd, 3rd).      | _Highlights the significant impact of socio-economic status._ |
| **Survival by Sex Plot**   | Bar chart comparing survival rates between male and female passengers. | _Confirms the "women and children first" effect._             |
| **Classification Report**  | Metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-Score) for the final model.             | _Quantifies the model's predictive reliability._              |
